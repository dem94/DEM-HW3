# DEM-HW3

Homework task to increase the accesibility of a website interface and clean up the code. Code provided and needed to be analysed and reviewed. 
Project was designed to refactor code - an important skill needed as a front-end developer. 
Code was messy and not all of the links were working - these were recoded to improve the client interface
Numerous challenges faced. Used a youtube video aide to improve the code. Applied the commands used to this project.
Difficulty uploading projec to github. Didnt manage to use commands to clone and push project - used an alternative method troubleshooted via youtube
End product - live functional website - accesibility has been improved and code cleaned up.
